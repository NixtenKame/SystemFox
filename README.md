# FluffFox — Bare Minimum Source Code

Welcome to the FluffFox repository!

## What’s inside?

This repo currently contains the **bare minimum** source code for the project, including:  
- Essential JavaScript files for core functionality  
- `structure.sql` files for the database schema  

Nothing too crazy or complex just yet — it’s a clean, simple starting point.

## What’s next?

This project will **grow and evolve** over time with:  
- More advanced features  
- Additional files and scripts  
- Improved structure and organization  

Stay tuned for updates as FluffFox becomes more powerful and feature-rich!
