# FluffFox — Bare Minimum Source Code

Welcome to the FluffFox repository!

## What’s inside?

This repo currently contains the **bare minimum** source code for the project, including:  
- Essential JavaScript files for core functionality  
- `structure.sql` files for the database schema  

Nothing too crazy or complex just yet — it’s a clean, simple starting point.

## What db do I use?

-The database I use is MySQL if you are wondering
-(Bonus)The programming language I use for the site is PHP that is the front end

## What’s next?

This project will **grow and evolve** over time with:  
- More advanced features  
- Additional files and scripts  
- Improved structure and organization  

## What do the comments in the code mean?

This perticular source code has comments in the code heres why:
- It's there to help you understand what the code is for and what it does
- It could also be instructions or options for edit so you know what to change
**Some files/pages may not contain comments, this is due to me, the owner just now putting comments over the next few updates you will start seeing more and more comments**

Stay tuned for updates as FluffFox becomes more powerful and feature-rich!
